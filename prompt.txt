Create a complete summary of the given transcription of an audio, which is transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper model.
If possible, use timestamps to divide the important sections.
Maintain the summary as close as to the original.
Do not add things that weren't said in the audio.
Do the summary as best as you could and do not forget to be as complete as possible.
And give a meaningful summary title. (For example, do not say "Summary of Audio Transcription" which is obvious that THIS IS a summary from an audio transcription.)

Format of the summary must be:
**Summary Title**

---

**Section title**  
[XX:XX:XX - XX:XX:XX]

- **Subsection title**
  - Point 1.
  - Point 2.
  - etc.

- **Subsection title**
  - Point 1.
  - Point 2.
  - etc.

**Section title**  
[XX:XX:XX - XX:XX:XX]

- **Subsection title**
  - Point 1.
  - etc.
